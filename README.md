# rdaprofile

A SPARQL query intented to create an application profile based on the official RDA definitions.
It allows the user to define what elements to copy from RDA, what properties (in addition to owl:sameAs) to use and what language or languages should be supported for strings.

IRI's will be based on the RDA lexical aliasses, with the language suffix. It is configurable what language (suffix) to base the URI's on.

## why

This query was developed to formalize the creation of the RDF definition of the RDANL application profile.
